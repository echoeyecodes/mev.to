const text = `Technical interviews don’t just test your understanding about [data structures and algorithms](https://google.com) for calculating the probability of events occurring. \n\n These interviews attempt to understand your level of responsibility in your previous projects, your communication abilities, as well as gauge your past experiences to see if you can make good decisions independently. This is why companies like Amazon have their 14 leadership principles. They don’t want to just hire another data scientist or software engineer.

For many interviewees who are only on their first or second interview, this might not be as apparent because you are so focused on answering the technical part of interviews. However, as you are going through your technical interviews, there are some tips we would like to provide to help you better prepare for what lies ahead. \n\n

I recall my first interview with a FAANG.

After my first technical portion of the interview, I was interviewed by a TPM — Technical Project Manager. They started asking me about my experiences and the projects I had done in the past. At first, this wasn’t so bad. Then they started to ask about the impact I had in my current role.

After my initial answer, he asked a question which I had never thought about prior to that moment.

“How much time did that project save?”

I had never thought about this question before. At that point in my career, I had pretty much just been doing what I was told. Thinking about big picture concepts like impact and time-saved never came to mind. I was still a young developer, and I had only thought about programming and how to meet the needs of the people I supported. Suddenly, that was all thrown out the window.

The rest of the conversation followed a similar pattern. Every question I answered would be poked and prodded to gauge what my skills were beyond just programming. They were looking for ownership, and independent thinking, but I honestly hadn’t spent much of my time doing that at my current job.

My tip here is do be ready with numbers. Companies like Amazon are very metrics driven. They want developers and engineers who go beyond just developing. That means you need to be ready. When you are going for an interview, be ready with more than just an anecdote or two about what you have done. Make sure you are ready to explain the impact.

Think about your past projects, even if your company didn’t directly calculate the impact and/or estimate how much time it saved. You should take some time to estimate it yourself.

Having some metrics ready shows you think about the big picture and have ownership of your tasks. This can separate you from the pack and help you better understand how to operate at a FAANG. \n\n
# Do talk through your problem before you start \n\n
Most people’s first few whiteboard interviews are rough. You might freeze up because you are trying to get the perfect answer in your head before you even start. Or perhaps you start writing out the answer without communicating with your interviewer what your plan is.

It can be tempting to just start finding a solution right away. But this could send you in the wrong direction early on. You might find yourself 15 minutes into answering your first problem and no where near finding the answer.

So take a few minutes early on to frame your answer to your interviewer. Outline what methods, data structures, and algorithms you will use to get to your solution. This not only helps you solve the answer, but it also lets your interviewer know your thinking process.

Even if you don’t answer the question with the best answer, sometimes an interviewer will look on this more favorably. Communication is very important, and being able to talk through your process can demonstrates your ability to convey solutions.

In addition, if you have a stellar interviewer, they will often guide you to the answer. We are not saying they will spell it out for you, but they might ask questions that make sure you are thinking of possible edge cases and avoid major pitfalls.

Honestly, one of the best interviews I recall was one where it didn’t feel like an interview at all. It felt like two engineers working together to solve a problem. Of course, there are some interviewers on the other side of the fence who won’t help you at all. \n\n

This might be a cliché tip, but there is something off-putting about an interviewee with no questions about a job. Sadly, for your first job, you probably don’t care about the work.You just want the job. So coming up with genuine questions is difficult.

That doesn’t mean you shouldn't have a few questions prepared to show interest in the role.

I wouldn’t recommend you ask broad, company level questions that you can find out with a quick Google search. Instead, focus on trying to ask questions to your interviewer about their role. For example:
What has been the biggest technical challenge you have faced lately?
Do you feel like you have good growth opportunities here?
How would you describe the engineering culture here?
And so on.

These questions show you are personally interested at the job level. They also help you connect more with your interviewer.

Now that I have gotten older, these are the questions I would ask because I know it’s not just about the paycheck. I really need problems and projects that are challenging as well as impactful to the company.
Sure, working on the coolest technologies are fun. But there will always be cool new technologies. I care more about the impact the projects have than the tech stack that is used.

Some people reading this might still be in university. Some may not. For those in school, your school might provide practice interviews services. If so, then you should take them up on it. For those not in school, get a friend.

These services usually have tutors and employees who constantly provide practice interviews and have a good sense of how interviews go. That means you will get the closest thing to a real interview.
If you don’t have that, then, hopefully, you either have other computer science friends, or friends who are already employed at tech firms that can help you. The more comfortable you get talking through problems and doing them on whiteboards instead of doing them on computers, the better you will be.
